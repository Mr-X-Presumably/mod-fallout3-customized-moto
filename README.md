<h2>What Does This Mod Do?</h2>
This is a highly modified version of the Motorcycle Remake mod by alexkidd62, adding features, improvements, compatibility/features with the Helpless Falling mod, improved effects, and much more. 
<br />
<br />
The mod is still a WIP.

<h2>List of Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Performance improvements, code improvements, more code redundancies, and improved script logic</li>
  <br />
  <li>Expanded features including (untested) multiple motorcycles ownership; realistic motorcycle modification, building, and repairing requirements to make motorcycles--and the act of riding them--more rewarding, immersive, useful for tougher gameplay mod lists, and less OP</li>
  <br />
  <li>More realistic collision physics, now compatible with Helpless Falling, which promotes careful driving: colliding into solid objects at high enough speeds will throw the player off and deal potentially fatal damage, and colliding into mobs with higher ST than the total mass of the motorcycle may also result in getting thrown off the bike, unless there's enough mass/speed (from the player and bike's inventory) to push the mob instead</li>
  <br />
  <li>Realistic motorcycle attributes like fuel consumption, health, mass, weight capacity, maximum velocity, and damage potential, with things like total mass realistically affecting other attributes</li>
  <br />
  <li>Bikes can be damaged, repaired, and eventually destroyed if left unrepaired. Damage comes in stages, with damaged components applying their own relevant debuffs to the bike until repaired</li>
  <br />

</p>
  <li>Carefully thought out, realistic, and balanced build, repair, and modification item requirements that turn normally useless junk into useful crafting ingredients</li>
  <br />
  <li>Plausible, hand-chosen locations to find repairable motorcycle chassis, some already repaired and modified in select locations, and some unique models for variety. Collect 'em all!</li>
  <br />
  <li>Balanced speeds that don't break the game; non-OP gameplay enhancements and bike mods like faster traveling, extra storage, and killing potential</li>
  <br />
  <li>Graphically improved motorcycle models using Ajax120's models, and improved headlight effects</li>
  <br />
  <li>Code structure in place for future improved motorcycle sound effects for more seamless acceleration, turning, braking, and collision sound effects and at different velocities</li>
  <br />
</ul>
